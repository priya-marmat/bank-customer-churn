# Bank Customer Churn Analysis

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn for a bank to identify who is leaving, why they are leaving, and what the bank should do to reduce churn. The goal is to produce actionable insights and an interactive Power BI dashboard to help business teams prioritize retention strategies (especially for high-value customers).

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Understand overall churn and churn drivers.
- Segment churn by customer value (High, Medium, Low).
- Analyze churn across demographics (age, gender) and geographies (France, Germany, Spain).
- Study the impact of tenure, balance, salary, credit score, and product usage on churn.
- Provide prioritized recommendations to reduce churn and retain high-value customers.


## ðŸ“Š Key Findings (summary)
- **Total churn:** 2,037 customers.  
- **High-value churn:** 1,007 (â‰ˆ49.4% of total churn) â€” biggest revenue risk.  
- **Medium-value churn:** 856 (â‰ˆ42% of total).  
- **Low-value churn:** 174 (â‰ˆ8.5% of total).  
- **Demographics:** Highest churn among **adults (31â€“40)** across both genders; female churn counts are higher in several regions.  
- **Geography:** **France & Germany** are the top churn regions.  
- **Tenure:** Not only new customers: **long-tenure customers (9+ years)** are churning in significant numbers â€” a sign of declining loyalty.


## âœ… Recommendations (executive)
- Prioritize retention of **high-value customers**: loyalty rewards, relationship managers, personalized offers.  
- Engage **medium-value customers** through cross-sell campaigns to increase their product footprint.  
- Launch **region-specific retention campaigns** for France & Germany.  
- Improve **onboarding** for new customers and **re-engage long-tenure** customers with refreshed benefits.
